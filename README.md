[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paholg/dimensioned.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paholg/dimensioned)


Dimensioned is a library for compile-time type checking of arbitrary unit systems.

To use, place in Cargo.toml:

```
[dependencies]
  dimensioned = "*"
```

Note, though, that it is currently going through volatile changes and will stabilize
sometime in the future.

Dimensioned has its own website, available [here](http://paholg.com/dimensioned/).
It is also on [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/dimensioned/).
