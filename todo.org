# Fixes

# "Skipped" things (i.e. to figure out and do)
- Index/IndexMut :: Lifetime stuff that I need to figure out
- Float :: In order to implement for Dimensionless, it needs Mul and Div implemented,
           but any attempt to implement them in a type-preserving way conflicts with the
           already existing definitions.
- Derived Units :: Get macro working for these. Probably syntax extension.
- constant initialization value :: Right now this is "1.0" for any type. Once associated
     constants hit, use std::num::One.

# Features to implement
- Dim :: Figure out if I want to implement any more traits.
- Macros :: Investigate better macros for implementing arbitrary functions.
- roots :: add others besides sqrt()?
