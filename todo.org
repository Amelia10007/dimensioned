# "Skipped" things
- Scalar multiplication/division :: waiting on Rust changes (I'm pretty sure) to have scalars on LHS
- Index/IndexMut :: Lifetime stuff that I need to figure out
- Float :: Implement for Dimensionless, this had dependencies on other thigns being implemented first

# Features to implement
- Peano Division :: Keep them a ring, so it won't be closed, but this will allow things like Gaussian units
- Unit system creator :: Probably a python script, to make it easy to make your own unit system
