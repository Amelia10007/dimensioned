# "Skipped" things
- LHS Scalars :: waiting on Rust changes (I'm pretty sure) to have scalars on LHS for
                 multiplication / division
- Index/IndexMut :: Lifetime stuff that I need to figure out
- Float :: In order to implement for Dimensionless, it needs Mul and Div implemented,
           but any attempt to implement them in a type-preserving way conflicts with the
           already existing definitions.

# Features to implement
- Dim :: Implement powi() and sqrt() and maybe cuberoot().  Figure out if I want
                 to implement any more traits for this.
- Unitsmaker :: Look into changing this to a syntax extension. Also figure out an
                elegant way to have derived units as constants.
- Macros :: Find a better way of writing macros to wrap arbitrary functions, or some other method.

- powi() :: want to do this in a way that makes sense
