# To do
- Derived Units :: Get macro working for these. Probably syntax extension.
- Index/IndexMut :: Lifetime stuff that I need to figure out
- Float :: Implement for dimensionless

# Questions
- roots :: add others besides sqrt()?
- make_units! :: Allow custom print function for advanced macro?
- Dim :: Figure out if I want to implement any more traits.
- Macros :: Investigate more macros for implementing arbitrary functions.

# Future
- constant initialization value :: Once associated constants hit, use std::num::One.
- Numbers :: Compare shoggoth to peano. Shoggoth should probablye be faster, and can
             count higher. Can it divide?
