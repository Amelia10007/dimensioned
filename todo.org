# To do
- Derived Units :: Get macro working for these. Probably syntax extension.
- Index/IndexMut :: Lifetime stuff that I need to figure out.

# Questions
- make_units_adv! :: Allow custom print function?
- Dim :: Figure out what other traits to implement.
- Macros :: Investigate more macros for implementing functions.

# Future
- Float :: Implement for dimensionless. This requires num::traits::Zero and
           num::traits::One. The new versions of these in std::num are much more
           compatible with dimensioned, so implementation of Float will wait until it
           uses these.
- constant initialization value :: Once associated constants hit, use std::num::One.
- Numbers :: Compare shoggoth to peano. Shoggoth should be faster, and can count
             higher. Can it divide?
- Numerics :: If and when Rust supports numerics and arithmetic in type signatures,
              switch to using them. This will likely correspond to a version 2.0 of
              dimensioned.
