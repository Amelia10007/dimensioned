# "Skipped" things
- LHS Scalars :: waiting on Rust changes (I'm pretty sure) to have scalars on LHS for
                 multiplication / division
- Index/IndexMut :: Lifetime stuff that I need to figure out
- Float :: In order to implement for Dimensionless, it needs Mul and Div implemented,
           but any attempt to implement them in a type-preserving way conflicts with the
           already existing definitions.

# Features to implement
- Peano Division :: Keep them a ring, so it won't be closed, but this will allow things
                    like Gaussian units
- Unit system creator :: Probably a python script, to make it easy to make your own unit
     system
- Dimensioned :: Figure out if I want to implement any more traits for this.
