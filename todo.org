# Fixes
- make_units! :: Investigate printing (try to just store integers, then make string at
                 the end. Could even use a helper function, so someone could define
                 their own)

# "Skipped" things (i.e. to figure out and do)
- Index/IndexMut :: Lifetime stuff that I need to figure out
- Float :: In order to implement for Dimensionless, it needs Mul and Div implemented,
           but any attempt to implement them in a type-preserving way conflicts with the
           already existing definitions.
- Derived Units :: Get macro working for these. Probably syntax extension.
- constant initialization value :: Right now this is "1.0" for any type. Once associated
     constants hit, use std::num::One.

# Features to implement
- Dim :: Figure out if I want to implement any more traits for this.
- Macros :: Find a better way of writing macros to wrap arbitrary functions, or some
            other method.
- roots :: add others besides sqrt()?

# Bugs
- make_units! macro :: errors for single unit systems.
- Sqrt :: getting linker error for Float::sqrt when I use my Sqrt
